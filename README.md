# unmountUnusedMacDrives

I've replaced my CD drive of my early 2011 MacBook Pro for SSD drive and installed a fresh OSX on it. Now on bootup and wakeup my mac starts both drives. Most time I don't user my HDD so I don't want it to suck power from my battery. 
This sctipt unmounts the second harddrive to save my battery power.


just execute this script with <code>sh unmountHDD.sh</code> to unmount the second hard drive wich are not boot-HDDs to save battery power on macbooks.

Works for me. -hope it does for you too.



```
sh unmountHDD.sh
```
